MovieAPP (Demo)
Well, itâ€™s my first time writing a README file, so here I goâ€¦

MovieAPP is a demo project developed as part of the Software Engineering (SENG321) course. The application offers a variety of features that enhance the movie experience for users, including:

-Movie Entry: Add and manage movie details.
-Movie Rating: Rate movies you have watched.
-Personalized Movie Recomandations: Create and organize your own movie collections.
In addition to these basic features, MovieAPP provides interactive functionalities such as:

Movie Night Planning: Organize a movie night with friends.
Mood-Based Recommendations: Get personalized movie suggestions based on your current mood.
One of the most exciting aspects of the application is its ability to create both an individual and social experience. Users can not only enjoy personalized recommendations but also share fun moments with friends.

For users who prefer not to register, we also offer the option to explore the movie collection through a Guest Mode.

We thoroughly enjoyed working on this project, and we are especially proud of the app's design. We look forward to creating more fun and engaging projects in the future. ðŸ§¿
